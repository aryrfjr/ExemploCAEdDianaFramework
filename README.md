# ExemploCAEdDianaFramework

This project was developed as a working **proof of concept** to demonstrate how to use [DianaFramework](https://github.com/aryrfjr/DianaFramework) in real-world scenarios. It was part of my independent effort to convince CAEd/UFJF to adopt the framework — which they later did, evolving it into their own internal solution. I ended up leaving the project in search of a better opportunity seven months after.

> 🔍 Designed in 2006–2007, this is a **snapshot of early Java enterprise application design**, using custom MVC logic, Swing UI, and JPA persistence.

## 🧪 What It Demonstrates

- Use of DianaFramework for real application logic
- GUI interactions built in Swing
- Modular design with JPA entity handling
- XDoclet-based metadata
- Ant build integration

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Java 5/6
- Swing
- JPA / Hibernate
- Spring Framework
- XDoclet
- Ant
- Subversion (now Git)

## 🤝 Context

This example project was used to present the benefits of architectural reuse to CAEd, leading to their internal adoption of similar principles. It reflects not just code, but also communication and influence — key soft skills in any senior developer role.

## 🧭 Why Share This Now?

This project is part of my professional archive, and a way to share a chapter of my journey with others who may only know Java from the Spring Boot era.
